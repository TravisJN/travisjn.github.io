            <p>Coding is a practice inherently personal and conducive to being practiced in solitude.  Nearly every programmer starts by writing small applications on their own, following an online tutorial or book and progresses through to larger and larger codebases.  The result (at least in my experience) is a collection of great personal projects that probably work as they're intended but are comprised of convoluted code and interdependent functions. </p>

<p>I experienced the pitfalls of coding this way when creating my midterm project for a video game programming class I was taking.  After attempting to create a "planet platformer", I had to pivot the idea into something more manageable.  Instead of rewriting everything from scratch I took some of the already written functions and pasted them into a new file which I proceeded to add onto.  I worked away for a week until I had one last day to finish up.  I was nowhere near completing the project and had to make another pivot.  This time though, I had a rather large amount of code written.  No worries, I thought, it's a pretty minor feature change just so I can get some semblance of a finished game turned in.  I quickly discovered just how deep of a hole I had dug myself into by failing to plan and modularize my code.  Scaling down my project by removing a couple features and then adding some functionality to implement the pivot resulted in my having to completely start over.  With one day left to create an entire game.  </p>

<p>The subsequent hours were spent copy/pasting functions into a new file and being forced to go through my code line by line, deleting interconnected function calls and now-unnecessary arguments, some of which I missed and caused me grief up to the minutes before I turned it in.  </p>

<p>Fast forward several months and it's time for our first group project here at MakerSquare.  Teams of 4, everyone working to make one seamless final project, and the majority of the time we'll be working remotely from each other.  It was pretty clear that modularity, communication, and extensive planning would be the keys to success.  So that's what we set out to do.  Modularizing our code so it was reusable and easily moveable was a result of planning out exactly what our product was going to do and what the functions were that would achieve our goals.  With the functions defined, we split up the work and made sure it was very clear to each and every one of the team members what each function would receive, where it was called from and what it should return, if anything.  </p>

<p>As the work began, consistent communication persisted throughout the 11 day project but more importantly, everyone knew exactly how every piece of the application worked thanks to a very long whiteboarding session that extending from the first day to the morning of the second.  There wasn't a single line of code written until halfway through day 2.  Every function was whiteboarded, every piece explained over and over again, and every person given a task.  </p>

<p>We all finished our projects and presented them Monday night.  The following day, each group had to pick another group's project to improve upon and add features to.  Every single other group chose ours.  </p>

<p>The Greenfield project was an incredible learning experience with respect to learning how to split up a project into manageable pieces for each individual to work on, prioritizing tasks to ensure each piece is implemented in the correct order, deciding what should be done so as not to block others from working on something, communicating clearly and often, deciding on scope and whether or not our plan is realistic, and too many other things to list.  The bottom line is there's a huge difference between coding a fun personal project at home and trying to make something practical, iterable, and scalable with a team; and the greenfield project has taught me those differences.</p>
